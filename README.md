This is currently a work in progress to build a new Laravel 5 compatible administration panel based on [AdminLTE](https://almsaeedstudio.com/preview)

## Status

This is working and in use on several projects.  There are a lot of things still to do.
See the **TODO** and **FIXME** notes throughout the code.

The controller endpoints for managing models are all OK.
The endpoints for working on settings haven't been done yet and will probably be abandoned.

The code has been brought across from AdminLTE, mostly unchanged except for minor refactoring.  The code has been
converted to PSR-2 standards.

There is a [working example application](https://github.com/delatbabel/example).
